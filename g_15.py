# Given an array arr of n integers. Your task is to write a program to find the maximum value of âˆ‘arr[i]*i, where i = 0, 1, 2,., n-1. You are allowed to rearrange the elements of the array.

# Note: Since the output could be large, print the answer modulo 10**9+7.

# Examples :

# Input : arr[] = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]
# Output : 40
# Explanation: If we arrange the array as 1 2 3 4 5 then we can see that the minimum index will multiply with minimum number and maximum index will multiply with maximum number. So, 1*0 + 2*1 + 3*2 + 4*3 + 5*4 = 0+2+6+12+20 = 40 mod(109+7) = 40

class Solution:
    def Max(self, arr):
        arr.sort()

        result = 0
        MOD = 10**9+7

        for i in range(len(arr)):
            result = (result+arr[i]*i)%MOD
        return result
    
sol = Solution()

arr = [5,2,3,4,1]
print(sol.Max(arr))
