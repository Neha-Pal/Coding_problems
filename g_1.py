# Given an array arr of size nâˆ’1 that contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to n (inclusive), find the missing element. The array is a permutation of size n with one element missing. Return the missing element.

# Examples:
# Input: n = 5, arr[] = [1,2,3,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation : All the numbers from 1 to 5 are present except 4.
